# tools/bench

Maintainer orchestration for the public `ninfer_bench` throughput tool, serving corpus/concurrency
runners, and the external Serve TTFT client. Correctness is owned by the affected suites under
[`tests/`](../../tests/README.md).

## Captured HTTP replay

replay_capture.py replays captured Anthropic/OpenAI JSON requests serially
against an already-running NInfer Serve process. It reads a JSONL manifest whose records contain
seq, timestamp, method, path, allowlisted headers, body_file, body_sha256,
request_bytes, and the original response_status. Raw body paths are relative to the manifest;
the runner verifies their size and SHA-256 before sending. Manifest records are sorted by seq,
then any excluded sequence numbers are removed.

~~~bash
export NINFER_API_KEY='local-test-key'
python3 tools/bench/replay_capture.py \
  --manifest /path/to/capture/manifest.jsonl \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8081 \
  --output profiles/bench/qwen-k7/replay.jsonl \
  --exclude-seq 1,5,6 \
  --server-default-seed 42
~~~

Set the test server's NInfer --seed 42 to apply the fixed seed only when a replayed request body
does not already contain seed. The runner sends captured bodies byte-for-byte and records
seed_mode (request, server_default, unspecified, or unknown), seed_value, and
request_modified on every result. It does not add or replace a request seed. Authentication is
read from NINFER_API_KEY by default; use --api-key-env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for another environment
variable. --auth-mode auto sends x-api-key for /v1/messages and a bearer token on other routes;
bearer and x-api-key select either scheme explicitly. The token is never written to output.

The output JSONL contains one metrics-only record per replayed request. It records HTTP status,
client time to first response body byte, observed time to first generated SSE delta, output tokens
when available, and decode tok/s when response metrics or streamed usage support it. Non-streaming
HTTP responses do not expose a client-observed time to first token; the server request log can
supply NInfer's exact TTFT. Response bodies, generated text, request bodies, body hashes, and auth
values are never copied into results. Output files are created with mode 0600.

For exact per-request NInfer metrics, start each test server configuration with a fresh
--request-log-jsonl FILE, then merge its request log after replay. A copied log can be merged
without issuing the prompts again:

~~~bash
python3 tools/bench/replay_capture.py \
  --merge-server-log profiles/bench/qwen-k7/requests.jsonl \
  --results profiles/bench/qwen-k7/replay.jsonl
~~~

When alignment succeeds, server_metrics.completion_tokens is the server's completion count;
server_metrics.timings_seconds.decode and .ttft are the server decode/TTFT timings; and
server_metrics.speculative.accepted_per_position, .accepted_tokens, .drafted_tokens, and
.rounds carry speculative decoding details. Top-level output_tokens, decode_tok_per_s, and
time_to_first_token_seconds use those server values when the server log supplies them. The runner
joins by replay sequence to ordered request_start/request_rejected events and internal request IDs.
It requires the fresh log's attempt count to equal the replay row count; if counts differ it
marks all rows count_mismatch and does not guess at the association. Such a merge exits with code
2.

Replay is serial by design, preserving capture order and prefix-cache opportunities, but it does not
recreate original client concurrency, network timing, connection pools, or client-side retries. The
capture format retains only its allowlisted request headers; authorization is supplied separately.
Use a dedicated test server with no unrelated generation traffic while collecting the fresh request
log, since sequence alignment assumes the log contains only this replay's requests. --min-seq,
--max-seq, and repeatable --exclude-seq select a subset; exclusions accept comma-separated
sequence numbers such as --exclude-seq 1,5,6.


## External Serve TTFT

[`ttft/README.md`](ttft/README.md) defines the black-box latency benchmark. The measurement runner
uses frozen text/media requests and public streaming protocols without calling Engine. A separate
controller manages the fixed Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4/FP8 Serve profiles and fresh-process isolation.

```bash
python3 tools/bench/run_serve_ttft_campaign.py --campaign resource --samples 5
```

The controller chooses the profile, starts and stops Serve for every sample, runs the external
client, stages the NVFP4 artifact once in `/dev/shm`, stores raw/progress/Serve artifacts below
`profiles/bench/ttft/`, records structured per-request Serve diagnostics, and writes Markdown,
JSON, and CSV summaries. The case catalog, exact profiles, TTFT boundary, and fixture qualification
are documented in the dedicated README.

## Corpus baker

`ninfer_bench` benchmarks prefill at an exact length by slicing the first `P` token ids of a
committed corpus, so the corpus must be real, in-distribution text (not random tokens) and at
least as long as the largest prefill you want to run. `make_bench_corpus.py` bakes that corpus
offline with a local Hugging Face Qwen3.6 tokenizer.

Outputs (committed):

```text
bench/fixtures/bench_corpus.ids            whitespace-separated decimal token ids (exactly --tokens)
bench/fixtures/bench_corpus.manifest.json  tokenizer id, token count, and source description
```

Content sources:

- Built-in curated multi-domain prose (Chinese / English / code / math) — the default. It is
  encoded WITHOUT the chat template or special tokens, then tiled (paragraphs rotated each cycle)
  and truncated to exactly `--tokens`. Repetition only fills length; because prefill/decode
  throughput is token-count / bandwidth bound, it does not bias the numbers.
- `--source-text <file>` (repeatable) — tokenize your own long meaningful text instead, e.g. a
  downloaded public-domain book or a concatenated document set, for genuinely diverse very long
  content. The committed default is `~64k` tokens; raise `--tokens` and/or pass `--source-text`
  for more.

The binary slices `[0:P]`; the manifest is provenance only.

## Requirements

Install the tokenizer dependencies into the active Python environment:

```bash
pip install -r tools/bench/requirements.txt
```

The tokenizer is loaded locally only; the tool never downloads from the network. Pass
`--tokenizer-path` or set `NINFER_TOKENIZER_PATH`.

## Regenerate / check

```bash
# Regenerate the committed corpus from the built-in bank (default 65536 tokens).
python3 tools/bench/make_bench_corpus.py \
  --tokenizer-path /path/to/local/Qwen3.6-27B/tokenizer \
  --tokens 65536

# Bake from your own downloaded/assembled text instead (kept local; not committed).
python3 tools/bench/make_bench_corpus.py \
  --tokenizer-path /path/to/local/Qwen3.6-27B/tokenizer \
  --tokens 131072 --source-text /path/to/book.txt

# Check that the committed .ids and its descriptive manifest agree; no tokenizer or source needed.
python3 tools/bench/make_bench_corpus.py --check
```

`--tokens` is the exact committed corpus size and the ceiling on prefill length; increase it (and
optionally use `--source-text`) to benchmark longer prefills, memory permitting.

## NInfer performance matrix

`run_ninfer_bench_matrix.py` runs the layered public-Engine `ninfer_bench` matrix against the native
`.ninfer` artifact and stores its local reports under `profiles/bench/`. Its defaults are:

```text
artifact: out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer
binary:   build/bench/ninfer_bench
corpus:   bench/fixtures/bench_corpus.ids
```

The matrix treats MTP `k=3` with the optimized proposal head as the primary path, keeps `k=0` and
`k=5` as controls, and sweeps `k=0..5` on representative context-decode cases. Decode-bearing cases
cover CUDA Graph and eager execution; prefill-only cases vary prompt length and prefill chunk.

```bash
# Configure the benchmark targets once; they are off in the default public build.
cmake -S . -B build -DNINFER_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON

# Inspect commands without running the model.
python3 tools/bench/run_ninfer_bench_matrix.py --preset core --dry-run

# Main run. Builds build/bench/ninfer_bench first, then writes JSON and summary.csv.
python3 tools/bench/run_ninfer_bench_matrix.py --preset core

# Longer run that adds 32k/64k prompt and context-decode points.
python3 tools/bench/run_ninfer_bench_matrix.py --preset full

# Run only the MTP draft-window sweep.
python3 tools/bench/run_ninfer_bench_matrix.py --preset full --suite mtp_sweep
```

Default outputs:

```text
profiles/bench/ninfer-<preset>-<timestamp>/
  commands.sh
  manifest.json
  json/<suite>/<case>.json
  logs/<suite>.<case>.stderr.txt
  summary.csv
  summary.json
```

Use `--resume` to skip completed JSON reports in an existing `--output-dir`, and `--preset smoke`
for a minimal script/runner check. `--no-build` uses the binary supplied by `--bench` without
building it.

Each raw report must be `ninfer_bench_report` schema v15. The flattened summary and schema-v4 matrix
manifest carry native facts from the report: architecture, public name, actual formats, prefill signature, artifact,
load/read/upload/staging values, Engine memory arenas including the non-additive Vision layout
inside the unified workspace and CUDA Graph allowance, per-test planned logical and
allocator-observed workspace peaks, KV capacity and
payload, configured proposal head and graph mode, phase timings and throughput, and speculative
rounds/drafts/acceptance/fallbacks. The matrix manifest is descriptive and records the commands and
selected local inputs; it does not make repository state part of report validity.

## Serving corpus benchmark

[Published coverage and model results](../../docs/performance.md) identify the recorded runs.
The [serving methodology](../../docs/performance/methodology.md) owns workload definitions,
metric boundaries, aggregation, comparison rules, and publication format. This section describes
runner usage and output files.

`run_serve_corpus.py` accepts explicit `--artifact LABEL=PATH` entries. Labels identify report groups;
the selected artifact supplies the architecture, public name and weight bindings.
Omitting `--mode` selects MTP0 and MTP3; repeat `--mode` to select a subset. Use `dflash7` for
Qwen3.6-35B-A3B DFlash K=7 and `dflash2_7` for Qwen3.8-27B DFlash2 K=7, with companion weights
in the selected artifact. `--sampling greedy` selects exact argmax; the default is stochastic.
Run commands with a selected Python 3.11 interpreter, as in the model-page reproduction entries.

The serial runner writes `run.jsonl`, `summary.csv`, `summary.md`, and per-server logs under
`server/`. JSONL contains the completed requests and responses; CSV/Markdown contain fixture and
category summaries. The output directory is supplied explicitly with `--output`.

Its schema-v7 result and flattened summaries retain the actual `prefill_signature`, request Host
exposure, and decode Host/Device-wait time per round received from the schema-v21 serving records.
Request exposure is a latency distribution value and is never summed across concurrent requests;
worker aggregation uses the serving `throughput.host_work` interval deltas. The stochastic route pins its complete
temperature/top-p/top-k/min-p/presence/frequency profile explicitly, so model-default changes do
not alter the measurement method.

## Concurrent serving benchmark

`run_serve_concurrency.py` selects `--suite decode-saturation` or `--suite corpus-makespan`.
Their distinct time boundaries and workload dispatch are defined in the
[serving methodology](../../docs/performance/methodology.md#workloads-and-measurement-boundaries).
Repeat `--concurrency` to select C points; each point starts a fresh server. The point report
records the actual Engine configuration, automatic KV capacity, shuffle seed where applicable,
dispatch method, and per-request positions.

Schema-v3 outputs include `points/*.json`, `server/*.jsonl`, and combined `summary.json`, `summary.csv`, and
`summary.md`. Corpus runs also write complete responses in `corpus/<point>/results.jsonl` and
per-request phase summaries in that directory; older campaigns may have only point reports and
server logs. Historical model pages identify the report directory associated with each table.

```bash
python3 tools/bench/run_serve_concurrency.py \
  --artifact qwen3_6_27b=out/qwen3_6_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --mode mtp3 --suite decode-saturation \
  --concurrency 1 --concurrency 2 --concurrency 4 \
  --decode-tokens 8192 \
  --output profiles/bench/concurrent-decode

python3 tools/bench/run_serve_concurrency.py \
  --artifact qwen3_6_27b=out/qwen3_6_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --mode mtp3 --suite corpus-makespan \
  --concurrency 1 --concurrency 2 \
  --output profiles/bench/concurrent-corpus
```

Use `--kv-capacity auto` when the fixed corpus needs more shared KV than the default 262,144-token
pool. A point is intentionally not resumable: combining fragments from separate server processes
would not preserve either a steady interval or one continuous makespan.
