 *
 * `x` is contiguous BF16 [5120,T]; both weights are contiguous BF16_CTRL [48,5120]; A_log and
 * dt_bias are contiguous FP32 [48]; g and beta are distinct contiguous FP32 [48,T]. The numerical
 * contract accepts every positive T. The oracle evaluates the logical formula naively in FP64
 * from the represented inputs. Projection
 * staging, accumulator precision, and any private materialization are implementation choices and
 * are compared with that oracle under the route's FP32-output criterion. All inputs and outputs are
 * non-overlapping. `ws` provides the transient capacity reported above and is scoped to the call;
 * there is no persistent state side effect.
