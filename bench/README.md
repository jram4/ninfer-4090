# Benchmarks

`ninfer_bench` measures the complete public `ninfer::Engine` route against a `.ninfer` artifact.
The `bench/ops/` `ninfer_<op>_bench` executables measure central Op contracts and their specialized
CUDA implementations for ncu/nsys work. Target benchmarks measure Program/model composition.
Correctness and model parity live outside this directory; development rules are in
[`../docs/maintainer/op-development.md`](../docs/maintainer/op-development.md).

## Build

```bash
$HOME/.local/bin/cmake -S . -B build-sm89 \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=89 \
  -DNINFER_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON

```

## Product benchmark

The benchmark slices exact token counts from `bench/fixtures/bench_corpus.ids`, calls
`Engine::prepare_tokens()`, then calls `Engine::generate()` once for each repetition. It does not
have a private prefill/decode loop and does not call target implementation interfaces.

The matrix contains three independently measured test kinds:

- `pp{P}` prepares `P` tokens and requests one output token. This is the smallest request that runs
  the model; `prefill t/s` is `P / GenerationTimings.prefill_seconds`.
- `tg{G}` prepares a one-token seed outside the reported phase and requests `G+1` output tokens.
  The begin-round token belongs to prefill, leaving exactly `G` tokens in the reported decode
  phase.
- `pp{P}+tg{G}` uses the same `G+1` convention after a `P`-token prefill and reports both phase
  rates from the same generation call.

All benchmark requests use raw output, disable model-default stops, and disable prefix reuse. This
keeps the requested token count exact without adding another generation path. When CUDA Graph is
enabled and the matrix contains decode work, one ordinary public generation request primes the
decode graph before warmups and measured repetitions.

## CLI

```text
ninfer_bench --weights <artifact.ninfer>
          [--corpus <ids-path>]
          [-p, --n-prompt <list>]
          [-n, --n-gen <list>]
          [-pg, --prompt-gen <P,G;P,G...>]
          [-r, --repetitions <n>] [--warmup <n>]
          [--max-ctx <tokens>] [--prefill-chunk <tokens>]
          [--kv-dtype <bf16|int8>]
          [--mtp-draft-tokens <0..5>] [--lm-head-draft]
          [--device <id>] [--no-cuda-graph] [--text-only] [--profile-measured]
          [-o, --output <table|json|csv>] [--output-file <path>]
```

With no `-p`, `-n`, or `-pg`, the matrix is `pp512` and `tg128`.

Example:

```bash
./build/bench/ninfer_bench \
  --weights out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  -p 512,2048 -n 128 -pg '2048,128' -r 5 --warmup 1
```

`bf16` selects BF16 KV storage and `int8` selects INT8 group-64 KV storage. MTP is enabled with
`--mtp-draft-tokens`; `--lm-head-draft` selects the optimized proposal head. CUDA Graph decode is
enabled by default.

Use `--text-only` to reject media and omit the vision workspace reservation when measuring a
strictly text-only 27B route.

`--profile-measured` is a benchmark-only profiler boundary. It requires exactly one selected test
and `-r 1`, synchronizes after warmup, and brackets only the measured repetition with
`cudaProfilerStart/Stop`. Use it with an Nsight Systems `cudaProfilerApi` capture range so artifact
load, graph construction, and warmup do not enter topology counts.

## Text linear Op benchmarks

`ninfer_linear_op_bench` exposes the registered 27B fused LinearSwiGLU and Q5 LinearAdd contracts
through their production dispatch at the default `T=1024` prefill extent:

```bash
./build/bench/ninfer_linear_op_bench \
  --shape MlpGateUp34816x5120 --qtype Q4 --linear-swiglu --t-sweep 1024
./build/bench/ninfer_linear_op_bench \
  --shape MlpDown5120x17408 --qtype Q5 --linear-add --t-sweep 1024
./build/bench/ninfer_linear_op_bench \
  --shape Out5120x6144 --qtype Q5 --linear-add --t-sweep 1024
```

The benchmark records the selected physical route, kernel variant, cold-cache timing, measured
tensor-core ceiling, and useful/executed throughput.

## Input-projection Op benchmark

`ninfer_input_proj_bench` measures the exact Qwen3.6-27B Attention and GDN input-projection shapes.
Attention production uses the two parent projections and its benchmark-only control uses the
former four logical projections. GDN production writes directly into the pitched final output;
its controls isolate projection time and the former materialize-plus-two-copy composition. All
timed operands are allocated before measurement, and each sample is preceded by a 256 MiB L2 flush.
Production accepts the Text token extent through the benchmark allocation limit; controls remain
limited to their Small-T domain.

```bash
cmake --build build --parallel --target ninfer_input_proj_bench
./build/bench/ninfer_input_proj_bench \
  --op all --t-sweep 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,128,129,1024 \
  --warmup 5 --repeat 50 --csv-out profiles/bench/input_proj.csv
```

The four-projection and materialize/copy controls exist only in this benchmark and are not
production-callable routes.

## Target MTP round benchmark

`ninfer_qwen3_6_27b_mtp_round_bench` measures the registered target's native proposal and
verification round without introducing a second generation controller. It loads the same `.ninfer`
artifact through the target-private package facade, prepares a real prompt with that target's
Frontend, and reports draft/accept statistics for the target-owned MTP schedule:

```bash
cmake --build build --parallel --target ninfer_qwen3_6_27b_mtp_round_bench
./build/bench/ninfer_qwen3_6_27b_mtp_round_bench \
  --artifact out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer
```

## Token-decision Op benchmarks

The G1 benchmark covers the Qwen3.6-27B full physical vocabulary with 248077 valid rows at
`C=1..6`, plus the 131072-row shortlist. Its `--control` route reads the same rotating payload and
uses the same launch grid without computing argmax, which provides the fixed-work comparison used
by the benchmark comparison:

```bash
cmake --build build --parallel --target ninfer_argmax_bench ninfer_sampling_select_bench
./build/bench/ninfer_argmax_bench
./build/bench/ninfer_argmax_bench --control
```

The G2/G3 benchmark uses physical rows 248320, valid token domain 248077, optional occurrence
counts, and every MTP window `K=1..5`. With no arguments it runs the full greedy/stochastic matrix;
individual routes are suitable for Nsight Compute capture:

```bash
./build/bench/ninfer_sampling_select_bench --matrix
./build/bench/ninfer_sampling_select_bench --sample --mode stochastic --top-k 20
./build/bench/ninfer_sampling_select_bench --mtp --mode stochastic --mtp-k 5 --top-k 20
```

## Pointwise Op benchmarks

The pointwise benchmarks cover the active Qwen3.6-27B routes plus repository-internal numerical
test shapes. `--control` preserves the selected kernel topology and payload while replacing the
mathematical operation with minimal bitwise work:

```bash
cmake --build build --parallel --target \
  ninfer_residual_add_bench ninfer_sigmoid_mul_bench \
  ninfer_gelu_bench ninfer_add_bias_bench

./build/bench/ninfer_residual_add_bench [--patches P] [--control]
./build/bench/ninfer_sigmoid_mul_bench [--tokens T] [--control]
./build/bench/ninfer_gelu_bench [--mode tanh|exact --columns C] [--control]
./build/bench/ninfer_add_bias_bench [--d D --columns C] [--control]
```

Aligned registered shapes use 16-byte BF16 packs in the cache-sized regime. GELU and AddBias
select their BF16x2 streaming routes for larger Vision items; odd or unaligned repository-internal
test shapes exercise the scalar fallbacks.

## Reports

Table, JSON, and CSV reports all identify the selected target, artifact, Engine configuration,
load summary, memory capacity, KV payload, workspace peak, phase throughput, and speculative
statistics. JSON schema version 9 records the public value objects directly:

- `load`: target, load/upload time, file/H2D/staging bytes, tensor count, and resource count;
- `memory`: weights/sequence/workspace arenas, planned context, KV storage, and KV payload;
- each repetition's `timings`: prepare, Vision, prefill, decode, and total seconds;
- each repetition's `speculative`: window, rounds, drafted/accepted tokens, fallbacks, effective
  round latency, and per-position acceptance.

`decode_output_tok_s` counts the requested `G` decode outputs. `decode_engine_tok_s` uses the
Program's speculative round statistics, so it also describes work performed by a final partially
committed speculative round. Reports also contain the command and machine information needed to
interpret a local measurement.

Raw reports and profiler captures remain local under `profiles/bench`, `profiles/ncu`, and
`profiles/nsys`.
